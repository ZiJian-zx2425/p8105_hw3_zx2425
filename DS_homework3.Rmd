### Problem 0

This solution focuses on a reproducible report containing code and text necessary for Problems 1-3, and is organized as an R Project. This was not prepared as a GitHub repo; examples for repository structure and git commits should be familiar from other elements of the course.

Throughout, we use appropriate text to describe our code and results, and use clear styling to ensure code is readable. 

### Problem 1
```{r}
data("instacart")

instacart = 
  instacart %>% 
  as_tibble(instacart)
instacart
```
#### Answer questions about the data

This dataset contains `r nrow(instacart)` rows and `r ncol(instacart)` columns, with each row resprenting a single product from an instacart order. Variables include identifiers for user, order, and product; the order in which each product was added to the cart. There are several order-level variables, describing the day and time of the order, and number of days since prior order. Then there are several item-specific variables, describing the product name (e.g. Yogurt, Avocado), department (e.g. dairy and eggs, produce), and aisle (e.g. yogurt, fresh fruits), and whether the item has been ordered by this user in the past. In total, there are `r instacart %>% select(product_id) %>% distinct %>% count` products found in `r instacart %>% select(user_id, order_id) %>% distinct %>% count` orders from `r instacart %>% select(user_id) %>% distinct %>% count` distinct users.

Below is a table summarizing the number of items ordered from aisle. In total, there are 134 aisles, with fresh vegetables and fresh fruits holding the most items ordered by far.
